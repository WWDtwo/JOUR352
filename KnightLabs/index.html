            <p>Josh Allen's official NFL headshot looks a little different this season.</p>
            <p>The normally happy-go-lucky quarterback is hot off the heels of his team's fourth playoff loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in five years. At age 29, both he and Bills fans are demanding results from the snake-bitten franchise.</p>
            <p>Allen took Bills fans by surprise with his stoic expression in his official NFL headshot. While some quarterbacks, namely Cincinnati's Joe Burrow and Baltimore's Lamar Jackson, never smile in their portraits, Allen has worn a toothy grin since his rookie year.</p>
