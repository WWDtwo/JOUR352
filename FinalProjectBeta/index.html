            <p>The third annual RisuCon recorded an attendance figure of over 2,000 anime enthusiasts Saturday, a new record for the nascent yearly convention. As Maryland’s <em>otaku</em> have flocked to the convention, organizers have had to scale up from a hotel lobby to entire fairgrounds generally reserved for festivals and occasionally auto racing. Here is how RisuCon has grown over the years and where organizers hope to take it for 2026:</p>

            <h2>Growing attendance</h2>
            <p>According to RisuCon founder John Ayche, the event drew about 300 people in its first year. Since then, that number has more than sextupled. The event sold out despite relocating to the Montgomery County Fairgrounds from the Sheradon Hotel in Silver Spring, which according to event organizers could not hold more than 500 guests.</p>
            <p>"We've been really excited to see how big the con[vention] has gotten," Ayche said. "This has grown more than any of us could have expected."</p>

            <p>In three years, RisuCon expanded from a gathering of cosplay enthusiast to a full-blown event complete with panels, vendors, and a board game hall. The event expanded from the cosplay scene to several facets of nerd-dom.</p>
            <p>RisuCon partnered with Game Kastle of College Park, MD, to add a game room to the convention. Located in the West barn on the fairgrounds, attendees could participate in classics such as Dungeons & Dragons 5e and new releases such as the anime inspired Rush.</p>
